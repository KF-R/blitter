# The Blitter Quick Start Guide

Fully anonymous/psuedonymous. No accounts. Secure Identity. Six memorable words to log in.

Ensure you have Tor installed (and running if on Windows).

1) Download releases archive for your platform (linux, Mac[^1] or Windows[^1]) and extract its contents.
2) Run `keygen` (use `--prefix` for custom prefix e.g. `keygen --prefix noob`)
3) From the command line, run `blitter`; take note of the **passphrase** displayed and the **onion address**.
4) Visit the **onion address** using the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) and login with the **passphrase**.
5) _Bleet_ public broadcasts, add other Blitter sites and exchange private secure _blat_ messages.
6) _Change the **secret word** in your_ `keys` _directory soon_. You will receive a new **passphrase**.
