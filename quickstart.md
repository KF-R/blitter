# The Blitter Quick Start Guide

Fully anonymous/psuedonymous. No accounts. Secure Identity. Six memorable words to log in.

Ensure you have Tor installed (and running if on Windows).

1) Download releases archive for your platform (linux/Mac or Windows) and extract its contents.
2) Run keygen (use --prefix for custom prefix e.g. `keygen --prefix noob`)
3) Run blitter; take note of the passphrase displayed and the onion address.
4) Visit the onion address using the Tor browser and login with the passphrase.
5) Bleet public broadcasts, add other Blitter sites and exchange private secure blat messages.
6) Change the secret word in your `keys` directory soon. You will receive a new passphrase.
